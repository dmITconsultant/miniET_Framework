# miniET_Framework

This is an unfinished project.  It is smaller scope than the ET_Framework project.  It too has become overwhelming, 
so I am sharing it with the community for any who would wish to finish and expand it.

The repository has the following special files:
* mini_ET_Framework.odt - needs to be opened and read using the latest Open Office Suite ( https://www.openoffice.org/ ).
* mini_ET_Framework.fsm - needs to be opened and veiwed using the FlowStone Programming Language from DSP Robotics ( http://www.dsprobotics.com/ ).
